# Blockudoku-automated

A recreation of the mobile game blockudoku with a little twist! I made a video to present the project, go check this out if you want! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfBY5MMdbb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfBY5MMdbb4)

## Description

In order to create this project I first created the game blockudoku. I then created an AI who play in our place. This AI is not trained but rather work with rules. Indeed I created rules that the AI follows to give a score to every move possible in every situation and based on this score, the best move is selected and played. The score is based on the number of faces of a piece is connected to other piece/wall and the number of horizontale/verticale and 3x3 square by placing a piece at a given place.
